	(1, 'Norway Leads the Global Electric Cars Market', '<p>Norway continues to lead the global market for electric cars, according to the most recent plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) index from IHS Automotive.</p>\r\n<p>Based on analysis of new vehicle registrations during the first quarter 2016, one out of every three vehicles registered in Norway during the quarter was a plug-in electric vehicle, reflecting more market penetration in Norway than any other major market tracked by IHS Markit within the index. In a previous study from IHS Markit, one in four vehicles registered in <a href="http://electriccarsreport.com/tag/norway/">Norway</a> during the same time frame a year ago were a PEV, which demonstrates the continued commitment to alternative propulsion vehicles in this country.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Other markets</h2>\r\n<p>The <a href="http://electriccarsreport.com/tag/netherlands/">Netherlands</a> continues to also be a hot market for electric vehicles, but has lost momentum recently and trails significantly behind with just 2.2 percent share of all new vehicles registered there being electric. France is gaining, with 1.6 percent share. The UK is the only other market tracked with share of more than 1 percent, with 1.3 percent of all vehicles registered there being electric.</p>\r\n<p>Other key markets still remain below a 1 percent average in electric vehicle market share with the US, Germany, Japan and China ranking further down in the index. While China leads in volume, with more than 32,000 electric vehicles registered during the quarter, its market share for EVs is just 0.5 percent. Additionally, recent announcements by authorities there aimed at potentially curbing the number of EV manufacturers may have an even greater impact on overall production in the region. Likewise, the US also has high volumes, with more than 26,000 units registered during the first quarter, however, just less than one percent of the total market.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Government incentives towards electric vehicles</h2>\r\n<p>Based on IHS Markit research, regional legislative activities have driven the EV movement in certain locations. Norway has historically been supportive with EV incentive programs and other efforts toward adopting green technology.</p>\r\n<p>"Attractive incentives in France are also spurring EV growth there", said Ben Scott, senior automotive analyst for IHS Markit. "However, a recent change in PHEV taxation in the Netherlands has somewhat inhibited the market in this country."</p>\r\n<p>German authorities <a href="http://electriccarsreport.com/2016/08/ev-incentive-scheme-attracts-nearly-2000-applicants-germany/">recently enacted a new subsidy</a> for PEVs during the second quarter, and IHS Markit analysts predict an uptick there is on the horizon.</p>\r\n<p>More countries are developing policies for incentives and building charging infrastructure capability, however, they will be unable to sustain these developments alone. Increased production of electric vehicles across the manufacturing base is required to make them more affordable for consumers, in order to allow for substantial growth of these types of vehicles, IHS Markit says.</p>\r\n<p>In current forecasts from IHS Markit, it is expected that plug-in electric vehicles will account for just 4 percent of light vehicles produced globally in 2020, up from about 1 percent in 2016, when the company expects an estimated one million electric vehicles produced globally by the end of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[source: <a href="https://www.ihs.com/Info/0715/automotive-vehicle-index.html" target="_blank">IHS Markit</a>]</p>', '2016-09-22', 'p01/01.jpg', 1),

That betters the current model but will put Ford far short of the EV leaders. The number is not fixed as Ford appears to be waiting for the EPA to release certified electric range and energy-efficiency data on its website.</p>\r\n<p>While the rise from 76 to approximately 115 miles of rated range is the big news, Ford\'s only electric car for 2017 also gets an incremental boost in energy efficiency, from 105 to 107 MPGe.

The company has not chosen to address the remaining drawback in the Focus Electric, however, which is its badly compromised cargo bay. While the electronics for the DC fast-charging are mounted behind the left-front fender charge port, the AC onboard charger continues to be sited between the rear wheel wells. This requires a box almost a foot high that stretches the full width of the cargo bay.Nissan had a similar problem in the first two years of its Leaf electric car, but it relocated its charger way back in 2013.Ford does fit a clever movable shelf that either tilts down to meet the bottom of the hatchback opening or lifts up to give a level floor in what remains of the cargo bay, but the infringement on load space remains a major compromise.</p>\r\n<p>Now, at last, it has an EPA range rating that\'s competitive with others in its class: the Nissan Leaf at 107 miles, the BMW i3 at 114 miles, and the VW e-Golf at 124 miles. This year\'s Chevrolet Bolt EV, of course, offers roughly double that range for several thousand dollars more—and seems likely to outsell the Focus Electric within a month or two.

Head of MINI brand management Sebastian Mackensen and Head of MINI series management Peter Wolf offer insight into this new near-series test vehicle, and explain how it retains go-kart feeling in the true spirit of a MINI during a test drive of this model:\r\n<p><em>"The hybrid MINI makes full use of the electric motor\'s entire torque, which is available right from standstill, allowing for catapult-like acceleration. Even after leaving the slower pace of the city, this vehicle maintains its zero-tailpipe emissions at motorway speeds. The high-voltage battery under the rear seats provides power for long-lasting electric driving. AUTO eDRIVE standard mode permits speeds of up to 80 km/h, whilst in MAX eDRIVE mode speeds of up to 125 km/h are possible. For Mackensen this is a question of character:"In a hybrid MINI model, driving electrically must also be an exhilarating experience. This means that entirely electric driving is not limited to speeds of 30 or 40 km/h, but to speeds well beyond city traffic pace."</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first glance, you wouldn\'t recognize the test car as a hybrid model. And that\'s not because of the camouflage foil used. The charging socket for the high-voltage battery is discreetly integrated in the left Side Scuttle. Everything also looks familiar in the cockpit. The start/stop button in the centre of the dashboard glows yellow instead of red. As usual, you simply press the button to start the car - this vehicle, however, remains silent as the model always starts in electric mode. The rpm counter in the instrument cluster on the steering column has been replaced with a power display. Keeping a close eye on this display is particularly worthwhile for the first few kilometres as it informs the driver about the electric motor\'s power reserves before the combustion engine fires up. When exactly the combustion engine starts varies depending upon on the vehicle\'s speed and the intensity with which the driver operate the accelerator pedal.</p>\r\n<p><em>"Testing the vehicle himself, Mackensen puts the car through its paces and demonstrates that you need to step on the accelerator peddle very firmly indeed to activate the second power source. Then things really start happening. With the combined output of both drives, the first MINI hybrid vehicle demonstrates unparalleled acceleration performance when compared with its combustion-only siblings."</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>"However, MINI\'s go-kart driving characteristics consists of more than just fast acceleration. Above all, this hybrid MINI has to prove how precisely it handles when taking bends on the most exciting, twisting roads. This is where MINI\'s plug-in hybrid concept plays its next trump card. "As far as the chassis and suspension are concerned, nothing changes from the conventionally driven model variants", says Wolf, "and the set-up benefits a lot from the hybrid concept". Thanks to the eDrive components, which are positioned very low down at the rear, the car\'s centre of gravity is lowered and the weight is evenly balanced between the front and rear axle - ideal for achieving an even higher level of legendary MINI agility."</em></p>', '2016-12-02', 'p10/01.jpg', 1),

	(17, 'China to loosen eCar rules for foreign makers', 'For some time Chinese government has been working towards dominating the world\'s production of lithium-ion battery cells and establishing a commanding electric-car industry.\r\n\r\n<p>This would not only position the country in crucial industries of the future but give it a way to start attacking the choking smog in its cities that affects public health.</p>\r\n\r\nWhile more electric vehicles were sold in China than any other market last year, most of those vehicles remain far from competitive in the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n<p>Recognizing that its native automakers could not succeed in selling cars in Europe and North America, the country has proposed to relax joint-venture rules for so-called New Energy Vehicles.\r\n\r\n<strong>Any non-Chinese maker wishing to build cars in the country is presently required to establish a joint venture with an existing Chinese carmaker.</strong></p>\r\n\r\nThe goal is for the local company to learn from the foreign maker, strengthening its future ability to compete. For this reason the country put in place very aggressive "guidelines" (or strong suggestions) for foreign automakers wanting to build electric cars in China. Three specific terms in particular were notable.\r\n\r\n<P>First, all non-Chinese automakers had to form new joint ventures specific to electric cars.\r\n\r\nSecond, and crucially, all intellectual property developed by that joint venture would be owned equally by the Chinese partner and the foreign automaker-unlike the more limited technology-transfer agreements of the previous decades.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the electric cars built by those ventures had to carry Chinese brand names-which is why the Nissan Leaf is sold in China as the Venucia e30.\r\n\r\nForeign makers simply found those terms unreasonable. While most complied with the guidelines and formed joint ventures, they stopped there: almost no new electric-car intellectual property was developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Now, China proposes to relax those rules for plug-in electric cars, to get more world-class cars on the road faster. </strong>\r\n\r\nChina hopes to deal with three major problems accomplishing its goal of leading global electric-car production.\r\n\r\n<strong>First</strong>, it reduces its dependence on foreign oil and the need to engage in the fraught politics of the Middle East and Russia.\r\n\r\n<strong>Second</strong>, in working toward better air quality, it reduces a serious threat to its social stability and a situation that has become an indictment of those in power over the last two decades.\r\n\r\n<strong>Third</strong>, it steers the country in a new direction after two decades of technology-transfer agreements with foreign automakers have largely failed to bring Chinese carmakers up to North American and European standards.</P>\r\n\r\n\r\n"<em>If China does relax the rules, we can expect the German makers, General Motors (with the Chevy Bolt EV or its Buick-branded equivalent) and even Tesla to move quickly to build higher quality, more premium electric vehicles in China</em>."- Michael Dunne of consultancy firm Dunne Automotive .\r\n\r\nSource: Green Car Reports.', '2017-04-18', 'p16/01.jpg', 1),
